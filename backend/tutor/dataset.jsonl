Here's an example of the binary search algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\n# This function performs a binary search\n# It returns the index of the target if found, otherwise -1\n\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]\nprint(binary_search(numbers, 7))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a function called `binary_search` that takes a list `arr` and a `target` value. The function uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the search boundaries. We calculate the middle index `mid` and check if the middle element is the target. If it is, we return the index. If the middle element is less than the target, we adjust the `left` pointer. If it's more, we adjust the `right` pointer. We repeat this process until we find the target or the pointers cross. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result."}]}
